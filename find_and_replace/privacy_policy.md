**1. Introduction**
Welcome to Find and Replace ("the App"), a Monday.com application designed to search and replace text in WorkDocs documents. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use the App.

**2. Data Collection and Usage**
The App does not collect, store, or process personal data outside of Monday.com’s platform. All data processed by the App remains within the Monday.com ecosystem and is not transmitted to external servers.

**3. Permissions and Access**
To function properly, the App requires permission to access WorkDocs content. These permissions (workdocs:read, workdocs:write) are used solely to execute the search and replace functionality as requested by the user. The App does not retain, analyze, or share any document data.

**4. Data Security**
We prioritize the security of your data and rely on Monday.com’s security infrastructure to protect your information. The App does not introduce additional storage, logging, or external data handling beyond Monday.com’s environment.

**5. Third-Party Services**
The App operates exclusively within Monday.com and does not integrate with third-party services that access or store user data.

**6. User Rights**
As the App does not collect or store personal data, users do not need to request data deletion or modification. All document changes occur within Monday.com and are subject to its data policies.

**7. Changes to this Privacy Policy**
We may update this Privacy Policy as necessary. Any changes will be communicated through the App or our website. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

**8. Contact Information**
